# ğŸ§® React Calculator App

This calculator project was built as part of my practice while learning **React**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app is interactive, responsive, and supports both button clicks and keyboard inputs.

It helped reinforce core concepts of component-based architecture, state management, event handling, and basic styling using CSS and Bootstrap.
